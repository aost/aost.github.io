title: Software == limitless possibility
---

To make software that puts a dent in the universe, it is essential to be able to see past the status quo of software and understand its capacity to do literally anything imaginable.

What is software? It is a series of instructions for manipulating information on a computer. These instructions can be anything a person can logically communicate, and computers can carry them out at rates exceeding 50 billion per second.

No one can think of all the possibilities for software, but here are a few general ideas that have proven popular:

## Communication platforms

Since computers tend to be *inter*con*ne*c*t*ed, plenty of software has emerged that helps people express themselves to others around the world. One can easily [broadcast a public message](http://twitter.com), [contribute to a universal repository of knowledge](http://wikipedia.org), [release the next big hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes), and make lifelong friends, all from the confines of their bedroom.

## Creative tools

There is software that gives people the power to create and manipulate any sort of media with unprecedented efficiency and detail. With practice, you can turn visual and aural representations of reality into whatever you can imagine. [This song knows what I’m talking about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwvaodjH5lU)

## Simulated worlds

We can take what we made with those tools and selectively apply ancient knowledge of how our universe physically works to create software that runs entire audiovisual worlds born of our imagination, the rules of which are completely up to us.

These are just a few things software can be. We have only begun unraveling software’s vast potential and there may be entire categories like this that have not been thought of yet but will eventually become a part of our daily lives. The only limit is our imagination!
