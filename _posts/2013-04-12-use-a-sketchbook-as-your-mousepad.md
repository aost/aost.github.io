title: Use a sketchbook as your mousepad
layout: post

At one point I found myself with a mouse but no mousepad. I surveyed my room for a suitable substitute and settled on my sketchbook. It has a large surface and a satisfying texture.

It also has the advantage of being a surface that encourages you to write on it. Whenever a wave of inspiration hits you, you already have a page right in front of you to outline your ideas, draw wireframes and whatnot. As much as I appreciate the elegance of a simple text file, nothing can beat the flexibility and expressive potential of your hand, a pen and a sheet of paper. Then over the next several days or so, your mousepad will remind you of those great ideas you had and encourage you to work on them. You can use this area for a myriad of other things - reminders, to-do lists, and even angry scribbles when you are feeling particularly frustrated that day (that may sound silly, but it's actually quite therapeutic). As an added bonus, if you want to learn to draw but have a hard time mustering up the motivation to do it, this helps.

It's important that you use an actual large sketchbook with heavy paper, and not a notebook. In my experience, a notebook does not have the same inspiring effect; the lines and small surface are constricting and the texture doesn't compare.
