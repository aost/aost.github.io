title: Tin Bull retrospective
---
A few months ago I released [Tin Bull](http://tinbull.com), an anonymous discussion board. Its purpose was to be the next generation anonymous textboard and I hoped it would attract a community that would engage in civil, intellectual discussion Ã  la [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).

I designed it so that topics are sorted by heat of discussion, and posts within a topic are sorted by newness so that everyone has an equal voice. It also has throwaway pseudonymity that improves on [tripcodes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Tripcode.png), dynamic sections, and a clear visual design that adheres to fundamental design principles.

It didn't take off, but at the same time I didn't really draw attention to it. I lost faith in the idea after a realization: *good unrestricted anonymous communities are a myth*. Leadership with a heavy hand and a platform that promotes meaningful content is required to attract and maintain a high-quality community like Hacker News'.

Hacker News has a disproportionate amount of smart people who engage in insightful discussion. This is in big part due to the community being centered around the intellectually competitive and lucrative world of software startups, and being lead by an intellectual who [thinks](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) [a](http://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) [lot](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html) about what makes online communities and discussion degenerate or stay good. Even Hacker News has its fair share of duds, they're just harder to notice because the smartest content tends to bubble up to the top. On top of this, headlines are routinely desensationalized or outright hidden, and bad contributors are "ruthlessly banned" - free speech is sacrificed for the sake of propagating quality speech.

In an ideal world, Tin Bull's design would be great for discussion, but this is not an ideal world. Tin Bull's lack of poster identity and treating all speech equally almost encourages people to post carelessly. I have little doubt that this would cause Tin Bull to devolve into a cesspool like every other anonymous discussion board. Today I am convinced that thoughtful dictatorship, promotion of good content, and maybe an incentive to contribute good content like "karma" are key to fostering a good online community, and Tin Bull wasn't designed for those things.
